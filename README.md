# MSNumpressFSharp

This is a F# port of the C# version of the MS Numpress library. The original library can be found at https://github.com/ms-numpress/ms-numpress.

The library provides three algorithms for compression of mass spectrometry data. One algorithm is designed for the compression of linear data like retention time or m/z data. The other two algorithms are for compression of non-linear data with lower precision requirements, such as ion count data.
